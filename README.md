## Why

`NSSearchField` has a wonderful built-in mechanism for handling recents list which requires the developer to provide a menu to provide the recents list.  This class automatically provides a suitable localizable menu structure.

`DSFSearchField` inherits from `NSSearchField` so search delegates, actions etc. all work as expected.

## Installation

Note that currently to support localization you'll need to use the 'Direct' method below until Swift tool version 5.3 becomes more pervasive (it supports embedding localizations within modules)

### Swift Package Manager

Add `https://github.com/dagronf/DSFSearchField` to your project.

### Direct

Copy `DSFSearchField.swift` (and `DSFSearchField+SwiftUI.swift`) if you want SwiftUI support) to your project.

## Usage

### Via Interface Builder

* Add a new `NSSearchField` using Interface Builder, then change the class type to `DSFSearchField`.
* If you want to save the recent searches list, set `Autosave` in the Attributes Inspector of Interface Builder to a unique string for your project.

### Programatically

```swift
let searchField = DSFSearchField(frame: rect, recentsAutosaveName: "primary-search")
```

## Conveniences

### Search text change callback

This is called whenever the text changes within the search field.

```swift
   searchField.searchTermChangeCallback = { [weak self] newSearchTerm in
      // Do something with 'newSearchTerm'
      ...
   }
```

### Submit callback

This is called when the user presses 'return' in the search field.

```swift
   searchField.searchSubmitCallback = { [weak self] newSearchTerm in
      // Do something with 'newSearchTerm'
      ...
   }
```

### Simple searchTerm interface

You can set the search text using `stringValue`, but I personally find this scans badly when I'm trying to read and understand code. This class provides an additional property `searchTerm` more descriptive property name. This property is bindable and settable.

Simple setting of the search term

```swift
searchField.searchTerm = "cats"
```

Bindable observation of the search term.

```swift
searchField.addObserver(
   self, 
   forKeyPath: #keyPath(DSFSearchField.searchTerm), 
   options: [.new], 
   context: nil)
```

## SwiftUI

`DSFSearchField` provides a basic SwiftUI interface to the search control.

```swift
DSFSearchField.SwiftUI(
   text: $searchText, 
   placeholderText: "Search for colorsâ€¦",
   autosaveName: "SystemColorsSearchField"
)
```

### Available view modifiers

**Note:** Unfortunately, I could not figure out how to hook into SwiftUI's `onSubmit` view modifier (and it appears that
the required `Environment` values have not been made visible to the public. So that means that the default `onSubmit`
view modifier that SwiftUI provides will not be called.

#### `onUpdateSearchText`

Provide a block that gets called when the search text changes.

```swift
DSFSearchField.SwiftUI(...)
   .onUpdateSearchText { newValue in
      Swift.print("Update with new value -> \(newValue)")
   }
```

#### `onSubmitSearchText`

Provide a block that gets called when the search text is submitted (the user presses the return key in the field)

```swift
DSFSearchField.SwiftUI(...)
   .onSubmitSearchText { newValue in
      Swift.print("Update with new value -> \(newValue)")
   }
```

### Example

```swift
var body: some View {
   DSFSearchField.SwiftUI(
      text: $search1,
      autosaveName: "Search1"
   )
   .onUpdateSearchText { newValue in
      Swift.print("Update with new value -> \(newValue)")
   }
   .onSubmitSearchText { newValue in
      Swift.print("Submit with new value -> \(newValue)")
   }
}
```

## History

* `1.1.0`: Support for SwiftUI (macOS only)
* `1.0.1`: Brought menu labels in line with Finder.
